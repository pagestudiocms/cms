Modules
=======

Many add-ons need more than just functionality you can access via PageStudio tags. Sometimes you need an interface in the control panel, as well as other resources like javascript files.

Modules are the largest type of PageStudio add-on. They have a place in the control panel menu (usually), have control panel controls, their own widgets, and their own plugins and template tags.
